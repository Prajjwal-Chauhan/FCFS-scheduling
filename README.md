# FCFS-scheduling
This is a mini-project on Implementation of FCFS scheduling through doubly linked list.

Purpose:
This mini project gives us the knowledge about first come first serve (FCFS) or first in first out 
(FIFO) system. The purpose of this project is to give us the idea about the basic queue system that 
we have seen at various places in our day-to-day life.

Motivation:
FCFS scheduling supports non-pre-emptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm. It is non-preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm, so after the process has been allocated to the CPU, it will 
never release the CPU until it finishes executing.

Project Perspective:
Given n processes with their burst times, the task is to find average waiting time and average 
turnaround time using FCFS scheduling algorithm. First in, first out (FIFO) simply queues 
processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. In this, the process that comes first will 
be executed first and next process starts only after the previous gets fully executed.
